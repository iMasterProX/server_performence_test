# server_performence_test
This is a plugin created to test the performance of a Bedrock Edition server running with the Endstone server engine.

Every 5 seconds, it sends server performance data—including TPS, CPU usage, RAM usage, MSPT, and the number of online players—to users with Operator permissions. Additionally, for stress testing, if an Operator holds a Blaze Rod, sneaks, and right-clicks any block (long-press on mobile), the plugin spawns TNTs around the player and detonates them.
